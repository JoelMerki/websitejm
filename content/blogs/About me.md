## My life leading up to LBS

I was born on February 12th, 1997, in the beautiful city of Bern in Switzerland. After finishing my high school, I moved to Lausanne, where I started my bachelors degree in International Hospitality Management at **EHL Hospitality Business School**. I have always been curious and eager to get a broad perspective on career options and have tried to gather experiences in a variety of industries and countries. Before and after my undergrad I have worked in **hospitality (restaurants and hotels), real estate advisory, banking, consulting**, and I took over a **bar** for a short while. I also did the **Swiss military service**, went to Spain to learn Spanish, and traveled as much as I could in between.

> With the wish to shift my career to a more technical role and the desire to expand my academical experience, I decided to apply for the MAM.

## Interests

I have always loved being outside in nature and ideally, my free time and holidays are spent exploring and being outside. Some of my fondest positive memories are my off grid **roadtrips trough Iceland, Indonesia, or Norway**. On a daily basis, I enjoy doing sports whenever possible, from **tennis and football to the gym** (*see section "Normal Distribution in real life" all the way at the bottom of my homepage to see how you can explain to a "gym bro" what normal distribution means*) to stay fit and balance my professional life.
