## My life leading up to LBS

I was born on 12th of February 1997 in the beautiful city of Bern, Switzerland. After graduating from high school, I moved to Lausanne where I started my Bachelors degree in **International Hospitality Management** at **EHL Hospitality Business School.** I have always been curious and eager to explore different career options, which is why I have tried to gain experience in a variety of industries and countries. Before and after my studies, I worked in **hospitality (restaurants and hotels), real estate advisory, banking, consulting**, and I took over a **bar** for a short time. I also completed the **Swiss military service**, went to Spain to learn Spanish and travelled as much as possible in between.

> With a desire to shift careers and broaden my academic experience, I then decided to apply for the MAM.

## Interests

I have always loved being outdoors in nature, and my favourite way to spend my free time and holidays is to be outside and explore new places. Some of my fondest positive memories are my **road trips through Iceland, Indonesia or Norway**. In everyday life, I do sports whenever possible, from **tennis and football to going to the gym** to stay fit and find a balance to my professional life (*see the section "Real life example of Normal distribution" at the bottom of my homepage to see how to explain what normal distribution means to a gym enthusiast*).
