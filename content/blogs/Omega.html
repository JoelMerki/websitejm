<h1>Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination</h1>
<p>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.</p>
<p>You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

<p><strong>As the two confidence intervals do not overlap, we can say with 95% confidence that there is a significant difference in salaries between women and men. In the given sample, women have a lower mean salary than men. However, since the sample size is not large enough, further analysis would need to be made to make inferences about the population.</strong></p>
<p>You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using <code>t.test()</code> and with the simulation method from the <code>infer</code> package.</p>

<p><strong>The absolute t-value is greater than 4,the p value is lower than 5 % and the CI does not include 0, therefore we reject the null hypothesis and we can infer that there is a significant difference in mean salaries of women and men. This is reflected in the hypothesis test visualization using the infer package and the calculated p value which is lower than 5%.</strong></p>

<h2>Relationship Experience - Gender?</h2>
<p>At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Summary Statistics of salary by gender

<p>Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?</p>
<p><strong>Yes, there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives, proven both by calculating the confidence intervals using the formulas as well as performing the t.test. While this does not invalidate the conclusion that there is a significant difference in salaries between male and female executives, it does raise the questions whether or not the difference in salaries is purely due to the difference in experiences and not discrimination.</strong></p>

<p>You can use <code>GGally:ggpairs()</code> to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to <code>ggpairs()</code> with <code>aes</code> arguments to colour by <code>gender</code> and make ths plots somewhat transparent (<code>alpha  = 0.3</code>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Looking at the scatterplot, there is a strong correlation between experience and salary. However, there seems to be no clear difference in salary for man and women with similar amount of years of experience (5 - 20 years). We do acknowledge that there are a larger number of women who have little to no experience and are paid less while there is a greater proportion of men with more experience and higher salaries. Therefore, the differences in salaries can mostly be explained by the wide differences in experience, which can also be seen looking at the high correlation coefficient of 0.803 between salary and experience.</strong></p>
