# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination

The objective of the following analysis is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.


```{r load_omega_data}

# loading the data
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data","omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame

```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega` contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. 

Let's calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Additionally, let's create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}

# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
Summary_statisics <- mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)
    
# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% confidence interval
Adv_stats <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(
            mean = mean(salary),
            SD = sd(salary),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            SE = SD / sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * SE,
            CI_low  = mean - margin_of_error,
            CI_high  = mean + margin_of_error
            )

# Print out Adv_stats
Adv_stats
      

```

**As the two confidence intervals do not overlap, we can say with 95% confidence that there is a significant difference in salaries between women and men. In the given sample, women have a lower mean salary than men. However, since the sample size is not large enough, further analysis would need to be made to make inferences about the population.**

Subsequently, let's run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. 

```{r, hypothesis_testing}

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary ~ gender, data=omega)


# initialize test for hypothesis testing using infer package
Obs_stat_omega <- omega %>%
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

null_dist_omega <- omega %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

ggplot(data = null_dist_omega, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

# plotting hypothesis test using infer package
null_dist_omega %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = Obs_stat_omega, direction = "two-sided")

# p-value calculationg using infer package 
null_dist_omega %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = Obs_stat_omega, direction = "two_sided")


```

**The absolute t-value is greater than 4,the p value is lower than 5 % and the CI does not include 0, therefore we reject the null hypothesis and we can infer that there is a significant difference in mean salaries of women and men. This is reflected in the hypothesis test visualization using the infer package and the calculated p value which is lower than 5%.**


## Relationship Experience - Gender?


```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

Based on this evidence, can we conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Does the conclusion validate or endanger the conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?

**There is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives, proven both by calculating the confidence intervals using the formulas as well as performing the t.test. While this does not invalidate the conclusion that there is a significant difference in salaries between male and female executives, it does raise the questions whether or not the difference in salaries is purely due to the difference in experiences and not discrimination.**

```{r}

Experience_stats <- omega %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(
            mean = mean(experience),
            SD = sd(experience),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            SE = SD / sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * SE,
            CI_low  = mean - margin_of_error,
            CI_high  = mean + margin_of_error
            )

# Print out Adv_stats
Experience_stats

# 2nd test: T test 
t.test(experience ~ gender, data=omega)


```


## Relationship Salary - Experience ?


```{r, salary_exp_scatter}

ggplot(omega, aes(x = experience, y = salary, color = gender)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_lm() +
  labs (title = "Correlation between salary and experience", x = "Years of experience", y = "Salary") +
  theme_bw () 

```

## Check correlations between the data

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

**Looking at the scatterplot, there is a strong correlation between experience and salary. However, there seems to be no clear difference in salary for man and women with similar amount of years of experience (5 - 20 years). We do acknowledge that there are a larger number of women who have little to no experience and are paid less while there is a greater proportion of men with more experience and higher salaries. Therefore, the differences in salaries can mostly be explained by the wide differences in experience, which can also be seen looking at the high correlation coefficient of 0.803 between salary and experience.**
