<h1>Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing</h1>
<p>Let’s have a look at TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day over the past few years. We can get the latest data by running the following:</p>

<p>For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of
rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each
week/month of 2020-2022 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the
calculation <code>excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals</code>.</p>
<p>We chose the mean to calculate our expected bike rentals because it
allows for a more realistic prediction of future bike rentals. Many
outliers are cause by events such as tube strikes which are not one-off
occurrences and are likely to repeat in the future. Furthermore, the
expected rentals are calculated using data from three years so the
extreme points are softened.</p>
